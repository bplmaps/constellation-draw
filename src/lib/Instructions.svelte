      At the <a href="https://leventhalmap.org" target="_blank">Leventhal Map & Education Center</a>, we strive to make the world a brighter place for all. And as we
      reach the end of our fiscal year, we are counting on our supporters to help
      make our future work shine. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/catalogue/4/" target="_blank">celestial chart in <i>Heaven & Earth</i></a>, we're creating a constellation chart drawn by our supporters. 
      <strong class="text-blue-200">Draw your very own constellation and then donate $20 or more to become part of our special community-drawn star chart.</strong>
